Why should I care about DCE? What comes with my DCE Account? DCE is Open Source! How to access your AWS DCE account What\\'s this repo all about? Terraform module Your Jenkins Pipeline Deploying Terraform from your local machine A note about Terraform state Need Help? Common Errors Get in touch! What is DCE? Disposable Cloud Environment (DCE) is your playground in the cloud. With an AWS DCE account, you have a safe environment to experiment with in the cloud. With near-administrative access to your own personal AWS account, you can click around the AWS web console, run AWS CLI commands from your terminal, or run Jenkins pipelines however you want. As a developer, you don\\'t need to worry about cost management, orphaned resources, or lengthy cloud intake processes. Just remember: No PHI/PII, credentials, or sensitive information in your DCE account! Friends don\\'t let friends leak confidential records from managed health care technology companies. Why should I care about DCE? You should totally care about DCE. We have got the features you\\'re looking for in a cloud sandbox environment! Quick access No need for a lengthy cloud intake process. You only need your manager\\'s approval, and you\\'re ready to cloud like a boss. Budget Limits No surprise bills at the end of the month. Once your account hits a weekly spending limit ($200 - $1,000, depending on how much your manager likes you), your account will be automatically wiped clean to stop the bleeding. You\\'ll be kicked off the account until the end of the week, which is a bummer. But it\\'s better than explaining to your boss how you accidentally racked up $20k in cloud spend last month (trust me, I\\'ve been there!) Weekly reset Every Sunday night, your AWS account will be completely wiped clean, so you can get a fresh start on Monday. This limits security risk, cuts off excess spend, and encourages an Infrastructure as Code mentality. This keeps UHG security teams happy, keeps your manager happy, and gives you the space to need to learn, develop, and iterate. What comes with my DCE Account? First off, you get access to your own dedicated AWS account. You have near-administrative access to the account, with a few exceptions: Limited to us-east-1 and us-west-1 You cannot modify your own IAM Role or Policy You cannot create IAM users (use IAM Roles instead!) You cannot create AWS resources which DCE does not know how to destroy at the end of the week You cannot open up support tickets, or request service limit increases Our goal is to keep access as open as possible, while keeping our systems reliable and secure. If you find there are cloud services you would like to use but are unable to use, please reach out and let us know support Beyond the AWS account, we hook you up with a Gitub repo and Jenkins pipeline to give you a head start on exploring Terraform, infrastructure-as-code, and GitOps. See What\\'s this repo all about? for details. DCE is Open Source! github.com/Optum/dce Tell your friends, tell your neighbors -- anyone can contribute! Heck, you could even run DCE against your own personal AWS account, and protect yourself against surprise bills and hidden resources. The core components of AWS DCE are all implemented in open source DCE: account leasing, weekly reset, and budget enforcement. Optum\\'s implementation is a thin wrapper around DCE, with additional integrations for Azure AD, Launchpad, etc. How to access your AWS DCE account There are few different ways to access your AWS DCE account, depending on where you\\'re trying to get to. If you don\\'t yet have a DCE account, see the Request a DCE docs for instructions. AWS Web Console To access the AWS Web console: Login to your DCE dashboard at commercialcloud.optum.com/app Request or create an AWS DCE account, if you haven\\'t already Click on the AWS Account link From your local machine You can generate temporary credentials for your AWS DCE via the command line. The credentials will be stored in your ~/.aws/credentials file. This will allow you to: Run commands from your terminal with the AWS CLI tool Deploy Terraform configurations to your AWS account Execute custom code against your account using the AWS SDKs for python, golang, and several other languages To generate AWS credentials locally: Login to your DCE dashboard at commercialcloud.optum.com/app Request or create an AWS DCE account, if you haven\\'t already Click on the Local Development link Copy the provided commands to your clipboard, using the Copy to Clipboard button Paste the commands into your local terminal or command line Note that you must have the AWS CLI installed to use these credentials. See docs for Installing the AWS CLI. Via Jenkins Jenkins pipelines tied to this Github repo have access to a special withDCE method, which provides just-in-time credentials to your AWS DCE account. For example: node() { // Request credentials for our AWS DCE account. withDCE { // Checkout the latest code from your Github repo checkout scm // Run AWS commands here sh \\'aws s3 ls\\' } } See the DCE Credentials Delivery API for a deep dive into how this method works. What\\'s this repo all about? When you provision an AWS DCE account, you get: A dedicated AWS account A clone of this Github repo A Jenkins pipeline hooked into this repo, with access to your AWS account Terraform module To start out, this Github repo contains a simple terraform module, to configure a Launchpad compliant S3 Bucket. If you\\'re not familiar with Terraform, they have some really high-quality documentation you should check out. Or, if you\\'re the type of developer writes code first and reads documentation later (or never), jump right on ahead to the section on Deploying terraform locally. In short, Terraform is a tool for configuring cloud resources as code. The primary benefits of Terraform are: Configuration as Code Cloud resources can be managed as code in a Github repo, with changes automatically deployed via a CI/CD pipeline (eg. Jenkins). Desired State Deployments You can modify your configuration code, and terraform will detect and deploy the changes (rather than having to redeploy the whole stack). Wiring Together Resources Resources can reference one another in code, allowing you to easily configure large interconnected systems. Automated Dependency Graphs Terraform knows which resources need to be deployed in which order. Your Jenkins Pipeline Whenever you push a commit to this repo, Jenkins will trigger a CI/CD build, based on the configuration you specify in your Jenkinsfile. If you not familiar with Jenkins, they have some documentation you can look through. In short, Jenkins is not much more than a remote-server to execute arbitrary code, that\\'s hooked into your github repo. In practice, we use Jenkins to test, build, and deploy the code in our Github repos. A basic AWS DCE pipeline is made up of just a few steps: // Request a \"node\" or build agent to run our pipeline on node() { // Request credentials for our AWS DCE account. withDCE { // Checkout the latest code from your Github repo checkout scm // Your AWS code goes here. // The easiest way to get started is to run a \"sh\" command // which can run whatever bash code you want sh \\'\\'\\' # For example, we can use the AWS CLI to list buckets in our account # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/s3/ls.html echo \"Check out these bucket!\" aws s3 ls \\'\\'\\' } } For starters, your Jenkinsfile is configured to deploy the terraform module in this repo to your AWS account. Take a minute to look through that Jenkinsfile code, to get an idea for how it works. Your Jenkins pipeline has access to a handful of common tools for building code and interacting with the cloud. If you find there are system tools you\\'re missing, get in touch with us or open a PR against our dce_jenkins_agent repo. Viewing Your Jenkins Builds You can view logs from your Jenkins builds via the Jenkins web console: Login to the DCE web portal Click on the icon for your AWS DCE account Select the master branch (or whatever branch you\\'re working off of) Under Build History (left sidebar), select the latest build number Select Console Output (left sidebar) You can also navigate directly to the Jenkins CommercialCloud-DCE-AWS organization and scroll through the repositories until you find your DCE ID. Deploying Terraform from your local machine This repo includes a Jenkins pipeline to automate terraform deployments. However, you may also want to run terraform from your local machine. This is totally possible with AWS DCE, with just a bit of setup: Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine (from terraform.io, or via Self Service/App Store) Login to your AWS DCE account Run the following commands from your command-line # Navigate to the terraform directory within this repo cd terraform # Initialize your terraform module terraform init # Deploy your terraform module terraform apply See Terraform documentation for more info about these commands, and about writing Terraform configurations. A note about Terraform state Terraform tracks the current state of all your cloud configuration in a state backend. This state backend does a few things: Allows Terraform to compare the current state of your infrastructure against the desired state Associates terraform resources IDs (eg my_ec2_instance) with the deployed cloud resource IDs (eg i-2354634) Allows multiple people/processes to use terraform to manage the same set of resources By default, Terraform stores state in a local file on your machine. This is great for local development, but not for Jenkins pipelines, where the file system is wiped clean with every build. To work around this, the Jenkinsfile in this repo will create a state backend on S3 if one doesn\\'t already exist. This means that by default, Jenkins is not using the same state backend as you are on your local machine. So, for example, if you try to run terraform apply locally after Jenkins has already run, you\\'ll get back a ResourceAlreadyExists error. This is because your local terraform doesn\\'t know that the S3 bucket you\\'re trying to manage is the same S3 bucket that Jenkins has already deployed with Terraform. To solve this problem, you need to use the same backend configuration as Jenkins: View your latest Jenkins build At the bottom of the build logs, you should see something like: This Jenkins pipeline is storing state in an S3 bucket. You can point your local environment at the same S3 state bucket in order to manage the same set of resources, running terraform locally. Copy the following contents into /terraform/backend.tf terraform { backend \"s3\" { bucket = \"345185844623-dce-tfstate\" region = \"us-east-1\" key = \"dce.tfstate\" } } Do what it says, and copy that terraform configuration into /terraform/backend.tf Run terraform locally as usual from your local machine Need Help? Don\\'t feel bad -- DevOps is hard! And we could all use a hand from time to time. Common Errors We tried really hard to make your AWS DCE experience as seamless as possible, but errors have a way... Get in touch an let us know what you\\'re seeing! We\\'ll do our best to help you out, and document it in this starter repo so others won\\'t go through the same pain you did. Get in touch! See the DCE product support page to find the best way to get in touch with us. And if you haven\\'t heard, DCE is now powered by the open source DCE (pronounced \"dice\") project! Which means that you (or anyone) can contribute back to the project. github.com/Optum/dce ¬© 2021 GitHub, Inc.
